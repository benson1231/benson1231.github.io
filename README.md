# Personal Website

This website is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for building modern and responsive user interfaces. It follows a component-based architecture, making the codebase modular and easy to maintain.

This is my personal website, showcasing my background, experiences, and professional profile. Feel free to explore to learn more about me.
